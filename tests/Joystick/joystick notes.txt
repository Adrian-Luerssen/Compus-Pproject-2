we need at least 1 analogue port
we dont need reference voltages, so ADCON1 is MOVLW b'00001110' <-- only port RA0 is Analogue

		MOVLW b'00000011'
		MOVWF ADCON0,0
		MOVLW b'00001110'
		MOVWF ADCON1,0
		MOVLW b'10001001'
		MOVWF ADCON2,0


0V is left, 5V is right
0 is left, 1023 is right --> 511 is the centre

20ms period for PWM
THigh = Angle
0.5ms = 0deg
1.5ms = 90deg
2.5ms = 180deg

counter to change the position of the servo
the variable will be the one that dictates the T at high of the PWM
We may need to use TMRO with interupts to make sure that the PWM is always 20ms long

Button rising edge gives PWM of 0deg button falling edge gives PWM of 180deg
Down button can be implemented with polling as we only need to check it while we are in the manual mode
	this also stops the button being used while in different modes such as the UI or automatic mode
