		all keys pressed and delay between them are stored in the ram
		each time we record we need to clean the ram before as we do not want to overlap recordings
		enter and exit mode using recor button

Automatic Mode
	can only change mode when song has finished playing or song hasnt started playing
	RGB LED blue
	'P' signifies the start of a song
	we send a 'K' bck to signify that we are ready to play the song
	'S' signifies the end of a song
	we then wait for the nex 'P' or a change of modes
	

In either automatic or manual mode
	only if a song is not being recorded, a song is not being played and there is a recorded song
	we reproduce the song stored in ram when the user presses the PlayRecording
	no operations should be taken into account while song is being played
